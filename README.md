A small programming project for a Nike software engineering position

They told me to have fun with it.  I am.

This project is run using Intellij.
It takes the runner's id from the command line.
The data directory is not included in this github repository.  The data is in a diretory called 'data' at the same level as 'src' and 'test'.
