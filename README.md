# NikeRun
A small programming project for a Nike software engineering position

They told me to have fun with it.  I am.

How to run this
---------------
This project was created and run using Intellij. If you have Intellij installed, double click on the "NikeRun.iml" to open the project.  See later note about the data. 

Intellij ran from the 'NikeRun' directory.

It takes the runner's id from the command line:
StartMeUp <runnerId>

The data directory is not included in this github repository.  The data is in a diretory called 'data' at the same level as 'src' and 'test'.  I believe the data directory needs to be in the directory you run StartMeUp from on the command line.
